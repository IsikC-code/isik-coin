1.Abstract 

Isiklar Holding is a company with a history of more than 50 years in the construction materials business. One of the advantages of a company staying on top of this segment for so long and succeeding is that it has always trusted and stepped up to the latest innovations in manufacturing, distribution or administration.

That's why we create ISIKC(Işıklar Coin) to create a universal customer loyalty  program. Some of our partners  have been with us from the very beginning of the business, others more recently, but we feel our partners as our family. That is why, ISIKC will play the role of a customer loyalty program. 

There are discount levels depending on how much ISIKC you own and hold on your private account in ISIKC Platform,  on the materials that we produce in our factories that are part of the holding. You can find the discount levels below. 

We have decided to develop this program on precisely the most innovative technology today - Blockchain. The benefits that we see can also be found inside this document.

We believe that as much as our old partners are valuable to us, so are the new partners, which is why we do not separate according to the time we are together. 

Isiklar Coin (ISIKC)   is a decentralised  customer loyalty program  that uses Smart Contracts to create secure, indisputable transactions on the Blockchain. 

2. ISIKC Mission - Customer Loyalty Programs Need an Upgrade

In commerce , it is usually quick and easy for a consumer to sign up for a retailer’s loyalty program. But how many of your customers are actually becoming a loyal advocate to the brand?

Traditional loyalty programs suffer from the following issues that we believe that we ISIKC can solve. 

2. 1. Low redemption rates.

Perhaps because of the large number of loyalty programs in the market, it’s easy for them to get lost in the shuffle, and points go unredeemed. Surveys show that the average American is a member of 7 loyalty programs, and 30% of American consumers never redeem a single point. Until those points expire (if they ever do), they just sit there as a liability on a brand’s bottom line, having failed at earning repeat business.

2.2. High costs.

Large stores and successful ecommerce shops often pay high prices to setup and maintain their third-party integrations or custom solutions for customer loyalty programs. Whether they are making adjustments to an existing app or building their own from scratch, developer and maintenance fees can range from $2K – $15K a month for an enterprise-level solution. Understandably, if you are not seeing a strong ROI from reward program costs, it’s not worth it to keep the program.

2.3. Few customer incentives.

Today’s loyalty programs tend to favor the company providing them, instead of the consumer. For example, customers are forced to make purchases they don’t need in order to reap the rewards.
Research also indicates that 33% of millennial consumers dislike reward programs simply because there are too many cards to carry. If your loyalty program isn’t fostering a positive relationship with your consumers, what’s the point of it? 
2.4. Security concerns.
Some consumers may be wary of data breaches and the security of the information they give out when joining a loyalty program. A Harris Poll found that 71% of consumers were less likely to join a loyalty program that collected personal information beyond just name and phone number. They are right to have some concerns. In 2017, 11% of attacks on financial accounts were specifically on loyalty accounts, an amount that had risen from 4% the year before.





3. Problems and Solution




3.1. Problems

 • Fraud – Bots, spam programs and dubious Publishers trying to defraud Merchants by click spamming and other techniques
 
• Trust – A Publisher must trust that after directing a user to a Merchant’s website that a successful sale (or similar action) will result in them receiving a payment. 

• Sign-up fees – for both Merchants and Publishers. These can run into tens of thousands of dollars and often also involve a recurring monthly fee. This high barrier to entry has pushed many small and medium businesses away from Affiliate Marketing.

 • Late/disputed payments – Most affiliate networks have issues with Merchants not paying or disputing sales. • Broken offers and Voucher Codes – It is estimated that up to 80% of Voucher Codes found on the internet do not work. This is frustrating and time consuming issue for users. 

• Unique codes – Unique codes given to Publishers are often harvested by other Publishers and reused to claim commission. 

• Poor matches – Publishers select Merchants that may not be a good fit for the Merchant or the Publisher.



3.2. Solution

 • Fraud – Using Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts we can drastically reduce this, if not effectively eliminate it completely.


 • Trust – This problem is solved by the use of Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts. A successful task completion triggers execution of the Smart Contract and releases funds to the Merchant without the need for a middle man.


 • Sign-up fees – AffiliateCoin will have no signup fees and no monthly subscription fee. This will lower the barrier to entry and allow many more Merchants  to utilise Affiliate Marketing. 


• Late/disputed payments – The use of Smart Contracts will eliminate this problem because payments will be automated and every transaction stored indisputably on the public ledger of the Blockchain. 

• Broken offers and Voucher Codes – Using Smart Contracts we can ensure that the discount codes are active, and only grant commission to the authorised users as defined in the Blockchain. 

• Unique codes – Unique discount codes given to Merchant are stored on the Blockchain and verified as part of the Smart Contract. This means the reward can only be issued to the intended Merchant.


 • Smart matches – Using machine learning we are able to generate fantastic recommendations for the Merchants. This will create better relationships and drive higher ROI.



4. Smart Contracts : 

Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized Blockchain network. Smart Contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. They render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible. All transactions on the AffiliateCoin network will be part of a Smart Contract. This is one of the key principles of the network and will create a transparent mechanism for the Merchants, resulting in a trustless system. For the first time in the world of loyal partner program  both Merchants and Dealer will have complete trust in the transactions whilst simultaneously eliminating many of the fraudulent practices such as click fraud. This is especially important with newer technology such  as smartphones, with click based fraud increasing by 102% from January to April 2017


 Token Mechanism ISIKC is an ERC20 digital token in the Ethereum ecosystem compatible with the Ethereum wallet and with any other contract that uses the same standard. 

4.1. Security 

Formal verification which uses mathematical proof to detect whether our smarts contracts have executed correctly and without errors. Thanks to Ethereum Blockchain we have a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network. 


There is one of the main reasons we are able to operate this platform with just a 2 % commission on the transactions. Each Dealer when created will spawn a separate subchain and keep the transactions, deals and offers within that subchain. As a result are able to isolate each Dealer transactions to an individual subchain. 

4.2.Scalability


 The ISIKC network will have its own shard and its own transaction history. The effect of this will improve the number of transactions per second exponentially. This also will also increase our scalability as ISIKC will be able to connect with other shards and subchains on other networks. 


4.3.ISIKC 


Wallets From the ISIKC mobile and web application users can manage funds and transactions in a safe and secure manner. We are actively encouraging investors of all sizes and by removing the high entry barriers to our platform we are looking to attract investment from smaller Dealers as well as developers and conventional investors. Therefore, we are not enforcing a minimum deposit contribution. Some currencies do have a minimum amount for deposits, however, and this amount will be stated on the deposit page under each currency deposit address. If less than the minimum is sent by mistake, you can simply send more until the balance of the deposit address is above the required minimum. Furthermore, you can use a block explorer to track the address balance, simply search for your deposit address on the block explorer to check exactly how much you already have at your deposit address and how much you still need to send. 

Please consider the network fee when making the transaction. For example, 0.5 ETH may become 0.499 ETH after the network fee is applied. If the minimum limit is 0.5 ETH, then 0.499 ETH will not credit your ISIKC account until more ETH is sent. This applies to all coins with a minimum deposit limit. Once the deposit address is funded with the required minimum balance the whole amount will be automatically credited to the users ISIKC account.
